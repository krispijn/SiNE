[Description]
SiNE is a platform for the evaluation of sensor models, command and control (C2) algorithms(1,2,3) and data structures in a naval environment. It features object modeling based on the work of Dr. F. Bolderheij(1) and is primarily intended as a means to simulate scenarios for the author's MSc thesis. It is a data generation application that sends it's simulation output (object positiions and so on) to a network port. This means a client application is needed to process this data, which is not included in this package.


[Requirements]
1. A Java IDE. It is being developed using Oracle JDeveloper 11g R2
2. A MySQL server (v5.5). Necessary creation queries will be put in the "MySQL"
	directory of the project.
3. MySQL JDBC Connector ( http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/ )
